Leadership is a journey, not a destination. While that may sound very cliche, the fact of the matter cannot be denied. Leadership cannot, and _should_ not, ever be considered a destination. There is no "winning" and there is no finality to it. It ebbs and flows with an organization, with a team, even with a single person. Leadership can be so many things, follow os many paths, and yield so many outcomes. In the end, the journey towards leadership is vague, subjective, and so very much based in one's own ability to realize when they have begun down that path.

These are the people that spread ideas, share knowledge, and encourage growth through line-level camaraderie and a collective buy-in to some new way of doing things. This is where my journey into leadership began.

Being an influencer is strange, make no mistake. It can best be described as a role where you have all of the vision, and absolutely none of the authority. To successfully act in this capacity,


The goal is to encourage growth and push the organization in a direction that makes sense for any number of reasons. Instead of doing this through a traditional top-down approach, one must instead build consensus at a grassroots level. Consensus building can take time, and it depends entirely on trust and a collective belief in this new direction. Trust must be established between an someone and those who would be influenced.  Once that consensus has been built, a nexus event or some other "Eureka!" moment must happen
